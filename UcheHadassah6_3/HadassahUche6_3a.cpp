/*Palindromes: a) Write a program which reads a word and checks if it is a palindrome 
by outputting the appropriate message: This is a palindrome accordingly. A 
word is a palindrome if the letters spell the same message when written both forward 
and backward. For example: madam, anna, bob, noon are palindromes.*/
